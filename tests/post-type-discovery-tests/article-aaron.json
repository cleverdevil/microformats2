Interestingly enough the production of this beer could be illegal under the oldest law in the world, which was made in 1516 and asserts that \"beer\" can only contain four ingredients: Hops, barley, yeast and water. This issue will be decided in a court of law and if it is found that it cannot be called beer, then they will have to label it as something else.

In this section we wanted to summarize the author's point of view as it came across in the story, but also capitalizing on the way he told it, VERY DRAMATICALLY. The poems he has supposedly written are very simple, yet extremely melodramatic. But even though it is meant to be funny, it still summarizes the author's actual feelings as told in his short story.

The reporter asks the Lebanese man how he feels and to no surprise finds out that the Lebanese man feels unwelcome. To Herr Helmut it feels like his duty. The reporter realizes what he's saying and feels she needs to do something about it and so she decides to call all Germans together to literally embrace/hug all foreigners. The irony in this piece is that the reporter never gets to know the Lebanese Man's name and consistently refers to him as a foreigner or an outlandish person.

First, we're going to listen to an interview they've conducted with Regina in Berlin. Now if I may introduce them, the first is Hildegard and for a long time she's worked for the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung here in Munich as a Reporter and also as an Editor. Her specialty, so to speak, is in psychological matters. Her sidekick, Monika, is a Germanistik student.</p>\n\n<p>Ekkerhard: \"So, what did you find out?\"</p>\n\n<p>Hildegard: \"Regina met her Man when he was a soldier stationed in Berlin. He helped her when she negligently ran her car out of gas.\"</p>\n\n<p>Monika: \"One of my colleagues developed this machine, which is really a type of computer that can tell us what our victim is actually thinking, therefore we receive accurate answers, instead of what they think we want to hear.

These electrodes are painful. Monika would be a satisfactory lover, if she \"really\" could be lesbian, but most of these young girls only have the courage to kiss another and not much more. I'd be more satisfied with Arthur if he didn't always behave like a such a cowboy. Whenever I ask him what he's going to do, I get the same answer. \"I'm stickin' to my guns girl, it's the code of the west.\" What the hell's that supposed to mean. He really is a victim of his passion. I should start smoking again. The kids are almost exclusively speaking English because of these blasted Disney films and I'm no longer part of the picture.
